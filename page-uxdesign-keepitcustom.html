                        <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>The goal with this interactive prototype was to take the Sketch wireframes above and show the interactive experience a user would have at the website.</p>

                        <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>This particular prototype is designed to test the experience of a user who wants to purchase a product, see the shipping cost as soon as possible, and checkout quickly and confidently.</p>

                        <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>Along your way through the experience you can also see the sorting options for viewing items and that there are options for choosing different sizes and colors. These portions are not interactive.</p>

                  <div class="overflow-hidden">
                    <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>User testing was by far the most interesting part of the process. I was able to test with three users and get some very great feedback on the overall design and experience.</p>

                    <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>All users were introduced to the experience in the same way.</p>

                    <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>First, I had them look at the homepage for 5 seconds and give me initial feedback on what they thought.</p>

                    <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>Next I had them explore the homepage themselves and have them talk out loud about what they were seeing and what they thought this website would do.</p>

                    <p data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.2}'>The next step involved me telling them that they where a user there to buy a product as a gift, to be interested in how much the overall cost would be, and complete the checkout. Along the way I would have them speak out loud as to what they were seeing and what they were doing. After the test I had them go back and look at the site and asked them to speak to anything else on the page they would like to.</p>
